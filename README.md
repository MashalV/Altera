## Development Process

The project was built with a focus on responsiveness and user interaction. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it was developed:

1. **Project Setup**: 
   - The project was initialized with `create-react-app`.
   - Components were organized into folders (`components`, `pages`, `utils`).
  
2. **API Integration**: 
   - OpenLibrary API was integrated to fetch book data based on the user's input titles.
  
3. **Recommendation Algorithm**: 
   - A function was created to compare the subjects between different books and provide recommendations based on shared themes.
  
4. **UI Design and Swiper Integration**: 
   - A grid and swiper layout were implemented using SCSS and Swiper.js to display book covers in a carousel format.
  
5. **Responsiveness**: 
   - The app was designed to work well on both mobile and desktop views using media queries in SCSS.

## Future Enhancements

- **User Authentication**: Allow users to save book recommendations to their profiles.
- **Advanced Filters**: Add filters based on book genres, ratings, and publication years.
- **Add tags**: Add tags to the books, mark as read or if the recommendation matches what you are looking for, or if you've read a recommendation and didn't like it (feedback)
